                The website you are using is my most recent dive into web development.
                It was developed using several tools, such as 
                    <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> and
                    <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a>.
                It is a single page application built and deployed at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, 
                which accesses GitHub for the building process.
                <br><br>You can view the repository <a href="https://github.com/Kimchy101/Portfolio">here.</a>

                This is a website for a hypothetical business.
                The site was mainly used to further expand my experience in web development and experiment in branding.
                It is a simple static website that utilizes basic javascript tools 
                like <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> 
                and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>.
